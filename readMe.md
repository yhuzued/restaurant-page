# Restaurant Page

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The main objective is to create a simple restaurant website using JavaScript to dynamically generate the content and manipulate the DOM. The project also uses webpack to bundle the modules and assets.

The website consists of three tabs: Home, Menu, About Us, and Contact. Each tab displays different information about the restaurant, such as its introduction, dishes and location. The user can switch between the tabs by clicking on the navigation bar.

The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript modules, DOM manipulation, event listeners and webpack configuration. It also showcases some basic CSS styling and responsive design.
